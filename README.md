# Machine Learning Insights

## Motivation 
Machine Learning is huge and provides a plethora of powerful techniques to solve problems that were out of our reach decades ago. However, this submerging amount of tools might become overwhelming as one tries to find the correct setup, and the goal of this repo is to propose a set of posts that dive a bit beyond the simple algorithm application in order to underline differences and similarities between some of the key machine learning concepts at our disposal. What are the common points between SVM and boosting? How does Game theory help to understand boosting? Why is ridge a particular case of Bayesian regression? 

## Structure
You will find in each folder a markdown file that Github will directly render in the browser (just click on it). The code that has been used to produce the posts will also be attached, at your disposal, and the data sources are always mentioned and public so that you can reproduce the experimentations. 

## Disclaimer
This work isn't research work, but rather a combination of experimentations and scientific popularization. Therefore, we consider our aim fulfilled if we could transmit an intuition about the concepts, and for the purist seeking proofs, details and a perfect rigour, I'm affraid we cannot satisfy you, but we welcome you to refer to the links at the bottom of each article in the hope that you could still learn something here :)
